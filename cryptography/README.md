## üéØ Exam Preparation

### Key Topics to Master

**Theory**:
- [ ] Difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption
- [ ] How hash functions work and their properties
- [ ] Digital signature process (sign & verify)
- [ ] Diffie-Hellman key exchange
- [ ] TLS handshake process
- [ ] Common attacks and defenses

**Practical**:
- [ ] When to use which encryption type
- [ ] Proper key management
- [ ] Choosing appropriate algorithms
- [ ] Identifying security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Using crypto libraries correctly

### Practice Questions

1. **Why can't we use RSA to encrypt large files directly?**
   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   RSA can only encrypt data smaller than the key size (minus padding). For 2048-bit RSA, maximum is ~190 bytes. Solution: Use hybrid encryption (RSA for key, AES for data).
   </details>

2. **What's wrong with using ECB mode for encryption?**
   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   ECB encrypts identical plaintext blocks to identical ciphertext blocks, revealing patterns in the data. Always use CBC, CTR, or GCM modes.
   </details>

3. **Why do we need both encryption and digital signatures?**
   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   Encryption provides confidentiality (only intended recipient can read). Digital signatures provide authenticity and integrity (verifies sender and detects tampering). Both are needed for complete security.
   </details>

## üîß Useful Tools

### Command Line Tools

```bash
# Generate RSA keys
openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in private.pem -pubout -out public.pem

# Hash a file
sha256sum file.txt
openssl dgst -sha256 file.txt

# Encrypt/Decrypt with AES
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in file.txt -out file.enc
openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in file.enc -out file.txt

# Generate random data
openssl rand -hex 32  # 256-bit random value
```

### Python Quick Reference

```python
# === Hashing ===
import hashlib
hash_value = hashlib.sha256(b"data").hexdigest()

# === AES Symmetric Encryption ===
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Random import get_random_bytes

key = get_random_bytes(32)  # 256-bit
cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_GCM)
ciphertext, tag = cipher.encrypt_and_digest(b"plaintext")

# === RSA Asymmetric Encryption ===
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto.Cipher import PKCS1_OAEP

key = RSA.generate(2048)
public_key = key.publickey()

cipher = PKCS1_OAEP.new(public_key)
encrypted = cipher.encrypt(b"secret")

# === Digital Signature ===
from Crypto.Signature import pkcs1_15
from Crypto.Hash import SHA256

h = SHA256.new(b"message")
signature = pkcs1_15.new(private_key).sign(h)

# Verify
pkcs1_15.new(public_key).verify(h, signature)

# === Password Hashing ===
import hashlib
import os

salt = os.urandom(32)
key = hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac('sha256', b'password', salt, 600000)
```

## üìù Cheat Sheet

### Algorithm Quick Reference

| Purpose | Algorithm | Key Size | Notes |
|---------|-----------|----------|-------|
| Symmetric Encryption | AES-256-GCM | 256 bits | Recommended |
| Asymmetric Encryption | RSA | 2048+ bits | Or ECC-256 |
| Hashing | SHA-256 | - | Or SHA-3 |
| Password Hashing | Argon2/bcrypt | - | High iterations |
| Digital Signatures | RSA-PSS/ECDSA | 2048+/256 bits | With proper padding |
| Key Exchange | ECDHE | 256 bits | For forward secrecy |

### Security Decision Tree

```
Need encryption?
‚îú‚îÄ Small data (< 190 bytes)?
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ RSA-2048 with OAEP
‚îî‚îÄ Large data?
   ‚îî‚îÄ AES-256-GCM (or hybrid: RSA + AES)

Need integrity only?
‚îî‚îÄ HMAC-SHA256

Need authentication?
‚îî‚îÄ Digital signature (RSA-PSS or ECDSA)

Need password storage?
‚îî‚îÄ Argon2, bcrypt, or PBKDF2 (600k+ iterations)

Need secure communication?
‚îî‚îÄ TLS 1.3
```

3. **Keep dependencies updated** for security patches
4. **Get security review** for critical applications
5. **Follow principle of least privilege**

### Learning Philosophy

> "The goal is not to become a cryptographer, but to use cryptography correctly."

Focus on:
- Understanding when to use which tool
- Recognizing common mistakes
- Following security best practices
- Knowing when to ask for expert help
